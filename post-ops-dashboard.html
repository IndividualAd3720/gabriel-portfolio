  <h1>Building an Internal Knowledge Base for Operations</h1>
  <p class="muted">Case Study · Feb 2025</p>

  <p>
    As operations scaled at Filcon Ventures, one recurring issue kept slowing teams down:
    <strong>knowledge was scattered</strong>. Critical processes lived in chat threads,
    personal notes, or someone’s memory. Onboarding took too long, and daily BAUs
    were interrupted by repeated questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    To solve this, I built a centralized <strong>internal knowledge base</strong> using
    WordPress and free hosting (profreehost) — designed to be a single source of truth
    for operations, customer service, sales, and support teams.
  </p>

  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">The Problem</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>No single place for operational documentation</li>
    <li>New hires repeatedly asking the same questions</li>
    <li>Tool links, logins, and workflows scattered across chats</li>
    <li>High dependency on senior staff for basic BAUs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These issues didn’t just waste time — they created operational risk.
    Knowledge loss meant mistakes, delays, and inconsistent execution.
  </p>

  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">The Solution</h2>

  <p>
    I created a structured internal help center that acts as a
    <strong>one-stop operations hub</strong>.
    The goal was simple: if someone asked “How do I do this?”, the answer should already exist.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Centralized documentation by department</li>
    <li>Step-by-step BAU guides</li>
    <li>Quick access to internal tools and links</li>
    <li>Searchable knowledge base interface</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Tech Stack</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>🧱 WordPress (content management)</li>
    <li>🌐 Free hosting via profreehost</li>
    <li>🎨 Custom theme styling for clarity and usability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Department-based categories (Ops, CS, Sales, Finance, HR)</li>
    <li>BAU playbooks and turnover documents</li>
    <li>Customer service and fulfillment guides</li>
    <li>Internal tools directory (ClickUp, Gmail, Shopify, etc.)</li>
    <li>Search bar for fast lookup</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Impact</h2>

  <p>
    The knowledge base significantly reduced repetitive questions and
    improved onboarding speed. Team members could independently
    resolve routine tasks without waiting for guidance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Faster onboarding for new hires</li>
    <li>Reduced operational interruptions</li>
    <li>Improved consistency in BAU execution</li>
    <li>Lower dependency on key individuals</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">What I Learned</h2>

  <p>
    This project reinforced that <strong>systems aren’t always code-heavy</strong>.
    Well-structured information can be just as powerful as automation.
    Building internal tools is about reducing friction — not showing off technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I were to iterate further, I’d explore:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Role-based access for sensitive documentation</li>
    <li>Version control for process updates</li>
    <li>Analytics to track most-viewed articles</li>
  </ul>
